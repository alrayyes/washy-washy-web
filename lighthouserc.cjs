/**
 * Category-score gates, not the `lighthouse:recommended` preset's few
 * hundred per-audit assertions — those fire on things unrelated to what
 * this site actually needs (PWA install prompts, HTTP/2 push, service
 * workers) and turn red for reasons nobody here would act on. Performance
 * is a warning, not a hard gate: a CI runner's CPU is not Cloudflare's edge,
 * and a slower runner one day shouldn't block a merge over noise. The other
 * three are deterministic properties of the markup and config, unaffected
 * by runner speed, so they gate for real.
